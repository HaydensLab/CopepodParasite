This is the repository for all complete files used in the final analysis steps for my BSc (hons) Biology in-silico undergraduate dissertation. it does not contain all of the raw reads and raw data as that would total over 100GB of storage. 

Contained here are:

R code
Bash scripts for the pipeline
Supplemental Table 1 (contains all selected gene transcripts prior to filtering)
The all taxa and opisthokont exclusive multigene tree files.
All single gene tree files (some may be fragment fusion files/attempts)
